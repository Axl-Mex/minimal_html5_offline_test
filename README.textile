h2. Minimal HTML5 iPad Offline Cache Test

This is a simple HTML5 webpage that can be used offline on an iPad. Add it to the homescreen, and it will open as a "webclip" / webapp in fullscreen without any safari elements at top (URL bar, etc.).

If this template does not work something is 1) wrong with your server or 2) wrong with your ipad ;-)
